# birthday-attack-script

This is a repo used to demonstrate the birthday attack across two files by trying to cause a hash collision based on the final matching characters of the real.txt and a modified fake.txt file.


To use this you can fork and pull it! Make sure to 'cd' into the 'src' folder, and then use 'javac Script.java' and then 'java Script [int]' with an int of your choosing to indicate how many iterations you want to do!
